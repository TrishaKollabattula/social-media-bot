Scene 1 \u2013 Opening (0\u20138s) Visuals: Wide aerial shot of a bustling city at night with glowing data streams (animated lines flowing across buildings). Smooth transition into close-up of glowing digital dashboards with real-time charts. Audio/Narration: Calm but authoritative voiceover: \u201cIn today\u2019s world, data is everywhere\u2014hidden in patterns, trends, and behaviors waiting to be uncovered.\u201d Scene 2 \u2013 The Challenge (8\u201318s) Visuals: Cut to office workers overwhelmed by cluttered spreadsheets and static reports.
